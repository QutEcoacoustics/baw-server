  module Example
    # A custom factory bot helper method that generates attributes in
    # format suitable for sending as a JSON payload in a request spec.
    # Relies on the given model having a factory of the same name
    # and also having a schema method defined on it's class if the
    # schema parameter is not provided.
    # The schema parameter must be a hash of a json-schema-style structure.
    # @param factory - the name of a factory to use instead of model_name
    # @param subset - an array of properties to keep, further filtering on the schema's writeable properties
