# refresher:
# our permission system has two options for non-user project permissions:
# 1) anonymous access (read or none)
# 2) logged in access (write, read, or none)
#
# The combination of these permissions can lead to the
# confusing case where an anonymous user can read a project
# but when they log in, they won't have access to it!
