%p= "Hello #{@owner_name},"
%p
  You are receiving this email because the
  = Settings.organisation_names.site_long_name
  website member
  = "'#{@sender_user.user_name}'"
  is requesting access to one or more projects:
%ul
  - @projects.each do |project|
    %li
      = link_to "#{project[:name]}", project_url(project[:id])
      = link_to ' (permissions page)', project_permissions_url(project[:id])

%p The reason they want access to the project(s) is:
%p= "#{@access_reason}"
%br
%p If you do not want to grant access, then there is nothing else you need to do.
%p To grant access, visit the permissions page for the project(s) listed above.
%p
  You can choose to give
  = @sender_user.user_name
  read only access or read and write access separately for each project.

Regards,
