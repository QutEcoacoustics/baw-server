%h1= 'Upload Instructions'

%h3
  1. Put audio files into one folder
%p
  Your folder should now look something like the image below:
= image_tag 'audio_upload_folder.png'

%h3
  2. Access server
%p
  Access the following host via scp:
%p
  %code= Settings.host.name

%h3
  3. Transfer folder to server
%p
  Transfer the entire folder to the following destination directory on the server:
%p
  %code= Settings.actions.harvest.to_do_path

%h3
  4. Create a harvest configuration file
%p
  The file
  %strong= "must"
  be named
  = link_to Settings.actions.harvest.config_file_name, harvest_project_site_path(@project, @site, format: :yml)
  file and
  %strong= "must"
  = "have the following format for uploading to site '#{@site.name}'"
%pre= render :partial => 'harvest.yml.erb'

%h3= "5. Transfer #{Settings.actions.harvest.config_file_name}"
%p= "It is important to do this as the last step. Once the system recognises the #{Settings.actions.harvest.config_file_name}, it attempts to start harvesting. After the transfer, your audio_upload_folder should be under the following path ON THE SERVER"
%p
  %code= Settings.actions.harvest.to_do_path
%p= "and look something like the image below:"
= image_tag 'harvester_upload_folder.png'

%h3
  6. Look for logs in your audio upload folder
%p
  %b
    process.log
%p= "A process.log file will indicate what the harvester is currently doing."
%p
  %b
    error.log
%p= "If you find an error.log in your folder, please check it to see if the errors are caused by your #{Settings.actions.harvest.config_file_name}. If so, change the #{Settings.actions.harvest.config_file_name} and transfer it over the existing one. The system recognises that the file has changed and will attempt to harvest the audio files in the folder again."
