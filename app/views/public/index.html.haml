%p
  Welcome! The
  =Settings.organisation_names.site_long_name
  is a repository of information and audio recording annotations for fauna that make human-audible sounds.
%p
  We gather recordings from a wide range of environments and find practical ways to annotate the sounds with information about what's going on in them.
  Then we enable that information to be put to use by ecologists and other parties interested in conservation.
