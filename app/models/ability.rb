    # Think of it as asking "can the current user read *a* project?" when using a class,
    # and "can the current user read *this* project?" when checking an instance.
    # This is mainly relevant for :index, :create, and :new.
    # since they do no have an instance of the model.

    # WARNING: :manage represents ANY action on the object.

    # ----------------------------
    #  - index and filter permissions are checked as part of filter query
    #  - new is usually available publicly
