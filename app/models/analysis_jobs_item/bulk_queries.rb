class AnalysisJobsItem
  # Bulk queries for AnalysisJobsItem. These insert or update many records at once.
  # Note: none of these really change the state of the records, they just
  # schedule those records to be changed through the state machine later.
  module BulkQueries
    # Creates records for all scripts and audio recordings for a job.
    # It bypasses validation and callbacks and does this as a one shot
    # sql query.
    #
    # This query is idempotent and can be run multiple times for the same job.
    # It is an upsert statement that allows the same filter to add new recordings
    # to an existing job.
    #
    # The `BawWorkers::Jobs::Analysis::RemoteEnqueueJob` does
    # the actual enqueueing by monitoring for records created by this function
    # (more precisely records where `transition == :queue`).
    #
    # As per `AnalysisJob.filter_as_relation` the items generated by this command
    # are ones the creator of the analysis job is allowed to access.
    #
    # It is not great to bypass Rails' creation and validation logic but it is
    # the only way to create a large number of records efficiently.

    # We have tests that ensure that the records are created correctly.
