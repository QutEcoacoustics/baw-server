  # We're using a volume mount for tmp because it offers better performance
  # than a bind mount. It also does not seem to suffer from cache/metadata
  # problems that bind mounts (see caching in cifs/nfs).
  # The downside to this is that we can no longer access files in /tmp on
  # out hosts for dev work.
  # 2020-09 update: we're now running in WSL2/linux hosts only. The disadvantages
  #  of bind mounts may be negated. Additionally we want to mount sub-directories in
  #  tmp (the default bind location for this volume) in different images which is tricky.
  #  Thus trialing running without volume
