# Old Changelog

## [Release 2.0.1](https://github.com/QutBioacoustics/baw-server/releases/tag/2.0.1)

- 2018-03-27
  - Media defaults to native sample rate when filtering out invalid available objects
    See [#363](https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/baw-server/pull/363)


## [Release 2.0.0](https://github.com/QutBioacoustics/baw-server/releases/tag/2.0.0)

- 2018-03-26
  - Adds support for more sample rates in media generation. Now the recording's native sample rate is always allowed,
    and support for returning 96 kHz files has been added. Note, this change requires a breaking change in the Media
    REST API, hence the major version bump. We have reviewed our code and have found no code that was dependent on the
    changes so we anticipate no breakage. Special mention to [@peichins](https://github.com/peichins) for the hard work
    required for this change.
    See [#351](https://github.com/QutEcoacoustics/baw-server/issues/351)
